# Introduction to Big O Notation and Sorting Algorithms
## Big O Notation
In computer science, Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It is used to analyze the time and space complexity of an algorithm as its input size increases. Big O notation is expressed as a function of the input size n, and it describes the worst-case scenario for the algorithm.

For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that the time it takes to complete the algorithm increases linearly with the input size n. On the other hand, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that the time it takes to complete the algorithm increases quadratically with the input size n.

Big O notation is an important concept in computer science, as it allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and choose the most appropriate one for a given problem.

## Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used to rearrange a collection of data into a specific order. There are several types of sorting algorithms, each with its own time and space complexity. In this README.md file, we will discuss some of the most common sorting algorithms:

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm compares each pair of adjacent elements in the list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process until the list is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large lists.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by sorting the list one element at a time. The algorithm starts with the second element in the list and compares it to the first element. If the second element is smaller, it is moved to the left of the first element. The algorithm then compares the third element to the first two and inserts it into its proper place in the list. The algorithm repeats this process until the list is sorted. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which also makes it inefficient for large lists.

### Selection Sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and placing it at the beginning of the list. The algorithm starts by finding the smallest element in the list and swapping it with the first element. It then finds the second smallest element and swaps it with the second element, and so on, until the list is sorted. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).

### Quick Sort
Quick sort is a more complex sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the list into two sub-lists, one with elements smaller than a pivot value, and one with elements larger than the pivot value. The pivot value is chosen arbitrarily from the list. The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-lists until the entire list is sorted. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case, but can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) if the pivot value is chosen poorly.
